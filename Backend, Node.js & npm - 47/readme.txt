FOR NOW DELETING THE NODE_MODULES FILES SO IF YOU WANT TO REDOWNLOAD IT JUST IN THE TERMINAL TYPE "NPM i" npm install so it will be redownloaded for your reference.




What is npm?
Full Form:
npm stands for Node Package Manager.

Purpose:
npm is like an app store but for JavaScript. Instead of apps, it provides packages (small blocks of reusable code) that you can add to your project to save time.

Who Uses It?
If you're writing JavaScript code, especially for Node.js or web development, npm helps you:

Find useful code written by others.
Easily include that code (packages) in your project.
Example in Real Life:
Imagine you're building a house (your project), and you need bricks, cement, and tools.
Would you make everything yourself? Of course not! You buy ready-made materials to save time and effort.

Similarly:

Your Project: Your JavaScript code.
npm Packages: Ready-made bricks/tools (like libraries) that help you build faster.
Key Benefits of npm:
Reusability: Instead of writing everything from scratch, you can use libraries like express for web servers or lodash for utility functions.
Simplicity: Download, install, and manage libraries easily with npm.
Sharing: If you write cool code, you can also share it with the world using npm.
What Can npm Do?
Install Packages:

Example: To install lodash, you run:
bash
Copy code
npm install lodash
This will download the lodash package into your project.
Manage Dependencies:

npm keeps track of all the packages your project uses in a file called package.json.
Run Scripts:

You can define custom commands (scripts) like starting your project or building files.
Visual Example:
If you're making a pizza:

npm = Pizza Delivery App.
npm Packages = Pre-made pizza bases, sauces, toppings, etc.
Instead of making everything from scratch, you use npm to "order" ready-to-use parts for your pizza.


















What is Node.js?
Definition:
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript outside of a browser (like on your computer/server).

Purpose:
Normally, JavaScript runs only inside a web browser (e.g., Chrome). Node.js lets you run JavaScript anywhere, making it perfect for building backends, servers, or tools.

Real-Life Example:
Imagine JavaScript is like a chef who always works in the kitchen (browser). Node.js is like moving the chef to work in a food truck or restaurant anywhere (outside the browser).

What is the Difference Between npm and Node.js?
Feature	Node.js	npm
What is it?	A runtime to run JavaScript code.	A package manager to install code (libraries).
Purpose	Lets you build and run JavaScript apps.	Helps you manage libraries for your project.
Comes with?	Built-in tools like fs, http.	Comes with Node.js (when you install it).
Analogy	It's like the engine of a car.	It's like the toolbox with spare parts.
Example Use	Create a web server, APIs, or backend apps.	Install and manage libraries like express.
In Short:
Node.js: Runs your JavaScript code anywhere.
npm: Helps you download and manage reusable code (packages).
