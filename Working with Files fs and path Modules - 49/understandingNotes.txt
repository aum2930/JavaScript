writeFileSync (Synchronous):
When you use writeFileSync in JavaScript (from the fs module), it blocks the main thread. This means that the code execution halts at that point until the file has been completely written. All other tasks have to wait until this operation finishes, which can cause delays if the operation is time-consuming. The sequence will be like this:

js
Copy code
console.log("Start");
fs.writeFileSync('file.txt', 'Hello, World!'); // This blocks the thread
console.log("End"); // This will only run after the file is written
In this case, "End" won't be printed until the file write is complete. This blocking nature can make your application slower, especially if you have long-running tasks.

writeFile (Asynchronous):
On the other hand, writeFile is asynchronous. It doesn't block the main thread. It starts the file writing process in the background, allowing other tasks to continue executing. Once the file has been written, the callback function gets called.

js
Copy code
console.log("Start");
fs.writeFile('file.txt', 'Hello, World!', (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log("File has been saved!");
});
console.log("End"); // This will run immediately after "Start"
In this case, "End" will be printed immediately after "Start", without waiting for the file to be written. Once the writing process is finished, the callback will be executed, and "File has been saved!" will be printed.

Conclusion:
Synchronous (writeFileSync): Blocks the code execution (not ideal for performance in async environments).
Asynchronous (writeFile): Doesn't block execution, allowing other tasks to run while the file is being written.
So yes, your understanding is correct! Asynchronous code allows your application to remain responsive by not blocking the main thread, letting time-consuming tasks run in the background.
